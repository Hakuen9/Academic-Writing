\chapter{Introduction}

[Hook]: Tay, the artificial intelligence chatbot which was taken down 16 hours after its launch, was a project being developed by Microsoft corp. [Contextualization]: The chatbot was influenced by the design of Xiaoice, another chatbot developed by Microsoft which is based in China. “XiaoIce has had more than 40 million conversations apparently without major incident”, however for Tay this was not the case. Tay was taken offline because it started tweeting anti-semitic and racist remarks. Microsoft stated that the remarks were triggered by trolls.

[Purpose and position]: This report will identify and research the technical as well as the ethical factors that could have led to the unexpected behaviour of the chatbot. Which led to it being taken offline. Microsoft corp. requested for a thorough root cause analysis on Tay AI. The conducted research serves as a recommendation for Microsoft corp. regarding the development of future artificial intelligence chatbots.

[Preview]: Firstly, the theoretical framework will elaborate on two main topics of this report. Weak artificial intelligence and ethical software development. It will describe the chosen definitions and used sources of this report. Secondly, we will present our findings in the Facts and Findings section. This consists of a technical analysis as well as an ethical analysis. Furthermore, the findings will be summarized in the conclusion. Finally, the recommendation will explain which elements of an artificial intelligence chatbot should be taken into careful consideration when developing and testing an intelligent chatbot.
