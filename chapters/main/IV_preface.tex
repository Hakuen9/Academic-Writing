\chapter*{Preface}

In the post propaedeutic phase of the Bachelorâ€™s programme Information Communications and Technology, we conducted a root cause analysis
on a failed artificial intelligence or IoT project. This report will provide a root cause analysis on technical aspects as well as ethical
aspects of the project. The definitions used in this report have been defined in the Theoretical Framework. The technical analysis and the ethical analysis will be presented in the Conducted Analysis section. Furthermore, the conclusion summarizes the conducted analysis. Finally, the conclusion will serve as a basis for our recommendations.
