\chapter{Conclusions}
In conclusion, the technical analysis supports the argument that Tay uses the input of its users in order to formulate a fitting response. As identified by the intelligence analysis, Tay learns from its users and there does not seem to be any limit in what could have been taught to Tay. Furthermore, the ethical analysis shows that developers of self learning software should give comprehensive and thorough attention to the potential unforeseen vulnerabilities because it could behave in a way that was not anticipated.

We would recommend implementing extensive filtering, common taboo and racist remarks are some examples. We think that a general rule of thumb would be words that are known to be discriminating or racist. In addition to extensive filtering, we would also suggest in developing a test framework where all kinds of topics and remarks will be discussed with the chatbot. This is in order to foresee that self learning software could behave in a way which was not anticipated at first.
